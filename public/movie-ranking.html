    <h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>

    <h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Schindler's List</h3>
        <p>This is my favourite documentary movie as it highlights the true nature of very few humans.</p>
    <h3>Batman Triology</h3>
        <p>This is a great Sci-Fi with a very magnificent story line. </p>
    <h3>The Matrix</h3>
        <p>This gives me more reason to believe in time travel, and also explains the world we might never be able to perceive as mare mortals.</p>
    <h3>Resident Evil</h3>
        <p>This is the greatest zombie themed afterlife movie I have ever seen.</p>
    <h3>Underworld</h3>
        <p>This is a the best Sci-Fi movie detaling the era of vampires and werewolves.</p>
