<h1>About </h1>
<p>I am Daniel Oshili,a Physicist with a B.Tech acquired at the Federal University of Technology Owerri.
  I am skilled in front-end web development, as a fast learner, I am very keen to learning while on the job.</p>

<p>I also have vast experience in automation enginering which I gained during my internship at SBC for a period ranging from June-December 2019 
  and also during my National Youth Service from july 2022-May 2023.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always wanted to be among the great scientists I fondly read about, I quickly realized I had a flare for I.T and I always sought out opportunities to better myself.
   I am open to trying out new things as learning is a continous process.</p>
